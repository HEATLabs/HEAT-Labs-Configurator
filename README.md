##  About

The HEATLabs Configurator is a desktop application designed to provide players of World of Tanks: HEAT with advanced control over game settings that aren't accessible through the standard in-game menus. This tool allows for fine-tuning of aiming mechanics, controller haptics, UI markers, performance settings, and more.

Built using Electron, the app provides a user-friendly interface for modifying configuration files that would otherwise require manual JSON editing. The configurator includes safety features like default value restoration and validation to prevent invalid configurations.

## Windows Security Notice

When downloading and running the PCW Configurator on Windows, you may see a warning that says "Windows protected your PC" or that the app is "not commonly downloaded." This is expected behavior because:

1. **No Code Signing Certificate**: The app isn't signed with a code signing certificate. Windows SmartScreen flags all unsigned apps as potentially dangerous.

2. **False Positive**: Some antivirus software may flag the app simply because it modifies game files, which is its intended purpose.

3. **How to Proceed**:
   - Click "More info" then "Run anyway" when you see the warning
   - You may need to add an exception in your antivirus software
   - The app is completely open-source - you can review all code before running

If you're uncomfortable with these warnings, you can use the [web version](https://heatlabs.net/playground/configurator.html) which provides similar functionality without requiring installation.

## Usage

1. **Load a Config File**:
   - Click "Browse Files" and select your `coldwar.project` file (typically found in the game's config folder)
   - Alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the app window

2. **Modify Settings**:
   - Navigate through tabs to find the settings you want to adjust
   - Use sliders, checkboxes, and dropdowns to customize values
   - Each setting includes a reset button to restore defaults

3. **Save Changes**:
   - "Save Configuration" overwrites the original file
   - "Export File" lets you save to a new location
   - Keyboard shortcuts:
     - Ctrl+S: Save
     - Ctrl+O: Open new file
     - Ctrl+R: Reset all settings

4. **Reset Options**:
   - Individual settings can be reset using the â†º button
   - "Reset All" restores all settings to their default values

## Web Version

For users who prefer not to install software or encounter issues with the desktop app, we provide a web-based version with similar functionality:

The web version has some limitations compared to the desktop app:
- Cannot automatically locate your config file
- Requires manual file upload/download
- Some advanced features may be unavailable
